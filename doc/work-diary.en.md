## Module Resolution Optimization (2025-04-15)

### Changes Made
- Added module resolution settings to improve import path handling:

  - Added `baseUrl` as "." to enable absolute imports from project root
  - Configured `paths` with "@/*" alias pointing to "src/*" for cleaner imports
  - Specified `typeRoots` to include both npm types and custom type definitions

### Verification
- Compilation successful with webpack
- All tests passing (3 tests)
- No compatibility issues found with new module resolution settings

### Current Status
- Module resolution optimization complete
- Import paths can now use "@/" alias for src directory
- Type definitions properly resolved from both npm and custom locations

- Record key decisions and their rationale

# TypeScript Configuration Change Log
Date: 2025-04-15

## Phase 1: Configuration Optimization
### Changes Made
1. JavaScript Processing
   - Disabled `allowJs` and `checkJs`
   - Removed JavaScript files from include patterns
   
2. Build Output
   - Added `build/**/*.js` and `out/**/*.js` to exclude list
   - Maintained strict type checking for TypeScript files

### Technical Impact
1. Improved build performance by:
   - Excluding JavaScript files from TypeScript compilation
   - Preventing unnecessary type checking of build outputs
2. Maintained type safety for TypeScript source files
3. Reduced potential node_modules related type errors

### Next Steps
- Verify build process
- Test TypeScript compilation
- Check for any remaining type errors

## Phase 2: Type Definition Updates
### Changes Made
1. Added Type Definitions
   - Installed @types/jsesc@3.0.3
   - Installed @types/require-dir@1.0.4

2. Dependency Verification
   - Confirmed existing @types packages
   - Verified compatibility with TypeScript 4.9.5

### Technical Impact
1. Improved type safety for external dependencies
2. Enhanced IDE support for jsesc and require-dir packages
3. Reduced TypeScript compilation errors

### Next Steps
- Verify TypeScript compilation
- Test development environment functionality
- Monitor for any remaining type errors 

## Phase 4: Source Map Configuration
### Changes Made
1. Enhanced Source Map Settings
   - Added `inlineSources: true` to include source content in maps
   - Set `sourceRoot` to workspace root for absolute paths
   - Configured `mapRoot` to match output directory
   
2. Existing Source Map Settings
   - Maintained `sourceMap: true` for basic mapping
   - Kept `declarationMap: true` for declaration files

### Technical Impact
1. Debugging Improvements:
   - Better source code navigation in debugger
   - Improved source file location resolution
   - Enhanced debugging experience with inline sources
2. Development Benefits:
   - More accurate breakpoint mapping
   - Better error stack traces
   - Simplified source navigation in production builds

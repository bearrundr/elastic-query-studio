## Module Resolution Optimization (2025-04-15)

### Changes Made
- Added module resolution settings to improve import path handling:
  - Set `moduleResolution` to "node" for Node.js-style module resolution
  - Added `baseUrl` as "." to enable absolute imports from project root
  - Configured `paths` with "@/*" alias pointing to "src/*" for cleaner imports
  - Specified `typeRoots` to include both npm types and custom type definitions

### Verification
- Compilation successful with webpack
- All tests passing (3 tests)
- No compatibility issues found with new module resolution settings

### Current Status
- Module resolution optimization complete
- Import paths can now use "@/" alias for src directory
- Type definitions properly resolved from both npm and custom locations

### Next Steps
- Proceed with build performance optimization
- Review and implement incremental compilation settings
- Configure source map generation options for debugging

## Work Guidelines
- Document detailed changes for each development phase
- Record major issues and their solutions
- Manage next phase plans and TODO items
- Highlight significant changes including performance improvements and bug fixes

## Notes
- Each phase is developed in independent branches
- Document code review feedback and modifications
- Record key decisions and their rationale

# CI/CD Implementation Plan

## Current Status

### CI (Continuous Integration)
Currently implemented in `.github/workflows/runTests.yaml`:
- Triggers on push to master branch (needs update to main)
- Triggers on pull requests to master branch
- Runs on ubuntu-latest
- Sets up Node.js 16.x
- Installs dependencies
- Runs basic tests

### CD (Continuous Deployment)
Currently implemented in `.github/workflows/publish.yaml`:
- Triggers on push to master branch
- Deploys to VSCode Marketplace
- Uses VSCE_PAT for authentication

## Phase 2 Implementation Plan

### 1. CI Improvements

#### Branch Strategy
```
main (production)
  └── develop (integration)
       ├── feature/* (feature branches)
       └── hotfix/* (urgent fixes)
```

#### Updated CI Pipeline
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop
      - feature/*
      - hotfix/*
  pull_request:
    branches: 
      - main
      - develop
```

#### Quality Gates
1. **Code Quality**
   - ESLint checks
   - TypeScript type checking
   - Code formatting verification
   - Code coverage requirements (>80%)

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests (mock mode)
   - Integration tests (real mode)
   - Coverage reports
   - Performance benchmarks

3. **Security**
   - Dependency vulnerability checks
   - Code security scanning
   - Secret detection

### 2. CD Improvements

#### Deployment Stages
1. **Development**
   - Automatic builds
   - Development environment deployment
   - Feature testing

2. **Staging**
   - Pre-release verification
   - Integration testing
   - Performance testing

3. **Production**
   - Manual approval process
   - Version management
   - Release notes generation

#### Manual Approval Process
```yaml
workflow_dispatch:
  inputs:
    version:
      description: 'Version to deploy (e.g., 1.2.3)'
      required: true
    type:
      description: 'Deployment type'
      required: true
      options: [production, beta]
    confirm:
      description: 'Deployment confirmation'
      required: true
```

### 3. Security Measures

#### Branch Protection
- Required reviewers (minimum 1)
- Required CI checks
- No direct pushes to main
- Up-to-date branch requirement

#### Access Control
- Limited deployment permissions
- Protected secrets
- Audit logging

### 4. Monitoring and Alerts

#### Deployment Monitoring
- Deployment status tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Performance metrics

#### Notifications
- Build failures
- Deployment status
- Security alerts

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 2.1 (Week 1-2)
- Update branch strategy
- Implement basic CI improvements
- Set up branch protection

### Phase 2.2 (Week 3-4)
- Implement quality gates
- Set up security scanning
- Add monitoring basics

### Phase 2.3 (Week 5-6)
- Implement staging environment
- Set up manual approval process
- Add comprehensive testing

### Phase 2.4 (Week 7-8)
- Implement production deployment
- Set up monitoring and alerts
- Documentation and training

## Success Metrics

### Quality Metrics
- Test coverage > 80%
- Zero high-severity security issues
- < 1% deployment failure rate

### Performance Metrics
- CI pipeline < 10 minutes
- Deployment time < 15 minutes
- Zero downtime deployments

## Rollback Plan

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Critical error detection
- Performance degradation
- Security vulnerabilities

### Manual Rollback Process
1. Immediate version revert
2. Incident investigation
3. Root cause analysis
4. Prevention measures

## Documentation Requirements

### Process Documentation
- CI/CD workflow guides
- Deployment procedures
- Troubleshooting guides

### Maintenance Guides
- Pipeline maintenance
- Security updates
- Performance optimization
